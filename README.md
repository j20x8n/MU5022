This assessment   invites you to   undertake an   independent   research   project on a   topic   from   the   field/s   of community   music, composition,   music education,   musicology,   performance, and   sonic   arts. This project can take one of the   following   formats:
•          3,000-word   essay   (submitted via   Turnitin)
•          15-minute   lecture   recital   (recording and   slides   submitted   via   MyAberdeen)
•          7-minute composition   (score   and,   if feasible,   audio,   submitted via   MyAberdeen)   or
•          A combination/adaptation agreed with the   course   coordinator.
You   may   have +/-   10%   either way   in the word count/   duration   of the   work. Your   project   will   be   marked   in accordance with the assessment criteria   in the   MMus   Programme   Handbook.
Regardless of the format you choose, the   purpose of this   assessment   is to   demonstrate   your   ability   to engage   in critical and   reflective thinking on your   chosen   topic.   To   this   end,   you   are   required   to consider the ways   in which your   project can contribute to further   understanding   of   existing   ideas,   debates and/ or approaches   in your chosen   field.   To   this   end:
o   For creative projects: You will   need to   provide   (of approximately 300 words)   a
rationale and   reflection   (i.e., what, why,   how, and what   did you   learn?)   on   the cre5ation and execution of your creative work. This   will   include   demonstrating   whose   ideas and techniques you are drawing on/   exploring   in   your   project.   Please   also   note, for such   projects, you will also   be   required to   provide   a written introduction/ overview of the creative   pieces you submit   for   final   assessment.
o   For written based   projects代 写MU5022 Research Practices
代做程序编程语言: Your essay should engage   in ‘   big   picture’   critical
reflection and the consideration of   multiple   perspectives and   ideas   on   your   topic.   It   will   not   be enough to simply   recite and   rehash existing   materials.   You   will   be   required to   demonstrate original thinking,   analysis, and   reflection   in your essay   and   show that you are able to contribute   to   the   ongoing   discussion   and   debates   in your      chosen field/ on your chosen   topic.
We will spend time in Workshop   Four   (Week   11) devising your   project. You   will   be   required   to   email to the course coordinator a short   blurb   (of   no   more than   250 words)   of what   your   proposed   project will   be (as   relevant: the topic and its   associated focus   /   context   and   rationale/   expected   output/s)   by the end of Week   13 (October 28).   This   will assist in   ensuring   your   project is   feasible   in   its   focus   and   allow   for   additional   guidance   as   you   move   forward   through   the   term.
Devising   your   project
In devising the   project   consider the following:
•          Your area/s of   interest   within the   six fields   outlined   above;
•          Your   creative   skills ability   and   interests;
•          The area of   interest you   may   wish to   pursue   as   you   continue   with   your   practice/   studies;
•          How the   project   may   sit   within   a   portfolio   of your   creative   work   or   support you   in   future   advanced studies   (where and as   applicable)
Assessment
The assessment criteria   relevant to your   project format   (composition,   performance and/   or   written   work) will   be applied   per the   rubrics   in the   MMus   Handbook. This   is addition to   the   requirements outline above   in   relation to creative and   reflective thinking,   and the   furthering   of   existing   ideas, debates and/ or approaches   in your   chosen field.
